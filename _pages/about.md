I am currently a Math+CS major at UCSD, and am especially passionate about machine learning and data. Previously, I have worked at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine on MRI coil classification.

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer on ACM @ UCSD to build a novel AI/ML project. I am also currently working as a Infrastructure Developer @ DS3 UCSD.
